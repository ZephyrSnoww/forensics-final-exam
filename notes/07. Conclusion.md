# Conclusion

After examining all the evidence and interviewing all suspects, we conclude that Ms. Macdonald is the top suspect. [[Evidence/The Finger Print|Fingerprinting]] rules out the two other teachers, and after [[05.2 Witness Statements|interviewing most parties involved]], Ms. Macdonald seems the most likely. According to herself, "Ombelli has a PhD in chemistry, and Clark has a masters", and as shown by [[05.2 Witness Statements#Can you tell me how to perform this pracitical exam|her responses]], she seems like she doesn't quite know what she's doing. 

### Means
The bunsen burner stands readily available in the classroom.

### Motive
Not wanting to get fired after failing the test.

### Opportunity
Being alone in the classroom with Mr. Smith after school on friday.
